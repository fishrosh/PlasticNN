# Plastic Neural Network
Simple neural net for simple people. It is set to train on MNIST dataset. Unfortunatelly (for now) MNIST file path is hardcoded in the main function. In order for net to work, you need to have an unpacked MNIST dataset in proper location. It has the option to manipulate input images to enhance learning. 

Compile with C++14 or higher flag.

Uses custom SmartMatrix class for computations.
